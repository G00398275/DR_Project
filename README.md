<br>
This repository was created to submit the required project for Data Representation module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in ATU.
The project consists of the creation of a Flask Application that has a RESTful API. <br>
The Flask Application links to one SQL database called 'nflstats'. Contained in this database are two tables. <br>
The two tables are data from quarterbacks in the NFL in 2022, and data from running backs.<br>
A web page was also created to consume the API, and the project has been hosted on python anywhere.<br>
***

## Running the application
1. The app can be run by cloning this repo from github on CMDER or another console emulator (git clone https://github.com/G00398275/DR_Project.git")<br>
2. Download and install [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/) to run Python code.<br>
3. Flask can then be used to run on a local host. Refer to [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) for a user guide.
4. The app has also been hosted on python anywhere. See http://datarepg00398275.pythonanywhere.com/main2.html for online hosting. <br>

### SQL
The data has been added to a SQL database called 'nflstats' on my machine. <br>
Running the code should also add this database to a local machine if required. <br>
An example of one of the database tables is given below. <br>
The user name for SQL is "root" and the password is blank (just press enter)<br>

### Python Anywhere
The web page has also been hosted on python anywhere for ease of access. The link is given above.<br>
A screenshot of the web page as seen on python anywhere can be seen below.<br>
